# UNOS-2023-CPRA-update
Code for calculating new CPRAs for all patients in a HistoTrac database using the UNOS beta CPRA API.

This code has the following requirements:

1.	The .rmd file is meant to be run in RStudio (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), which requires R (https://www.r-project.org/).
2.	You need to get access to the UNOS API Developer Portal (https://developer.unos.org/) and will need to request access to the “Hiso Lab Management (Beta)” API. Once you have access you will need to copy your key and secret to the code in this repository.
3.	You will need access to your HistoTrac server to get your patient data out. This repository has instructions on how to do that: https://github.com/k96nb01/R_HistoTrac_data_extraction.
